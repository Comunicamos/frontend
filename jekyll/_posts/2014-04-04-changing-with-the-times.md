When I came to work at the Guardian’s US offices a little more than a year ago, it was in large part because of those farsighted words. Amidst a landscape of “legacy” news brands with their heads in the sand, here was one making a bold commitment to its readers to evolve for the future.

That was inspiring in itself. And as an American, it was doubly exciting to get the opportunity to help develop a US readership for such a fearless yet fun-loving brand.

So I joined as a liaison between editorial and commercial teams in New York and digital development team in London, and immediately found myself with a front-row seat to the complex choreography of an organisation undergoing digital transformation and global expansion - all at the same time.

“But the Guardian already has a nice web site,” you might correctly point out, “It’s not as though you were starting from scratch.” True! But that site was created for desktop-users who were largely UK-based, for whom the Guardian is a household name. It also has hundreds of reporters, editors and producers to keep it humming along.

Today, our audience are increasingly mobile-users. Here in the US, the Guardian has a growing, impressive reach, and the US Snowden revelations lead to a worldwide debate on surveillance. The New York and DC offices are small though, and every member wears many hats. Efficiency is critical, and the majority of resources need to go toward creation not curation.

Ideally, an experience geared toward an American audience would enable editors to highlight news produced specifically for that audience, whilst still capitalising on the wealth of content produced elsewhere, but minimising or filtering out things that are very UK-centric.

Easy, right? I won’t bore you with the details, but suffice to say that the answer to questions like, “How can we keep this page the way it is, but just hide that box with all the book offers priced in pounds?” always started with a deep breath and, “It’s not quite that simple …”

With the beta site, it finally is that simple. The underlying architecture was created with flexibility in mind; it’s easy to hide things that aren’t relevant - and easy to share things that are. If an editor in New York pulls together a lovely collection of stories and picture galleries on the Oscars to use on the homepage, the team in London can easily grab that same collection and feature it on the Film section front.

This opens up whole new ways of working together, and makes it simple for one person to keep stories fresh in multiple places. The result is a better experience for readers – and this is just the beginning.

The biggest challenge of tackling digital transformation and global expansion simultaneously is that people need to work together in ways they never have before. Teams that used to be able to operate largely independently now need to collaborate and work in sync. An audience that used to primarily consume now also has the ability to contribute, in situ, and the voices are from all over the world.

The only way to make that work seamlessly is to build tools that enable us to align around the needs of the people we exist for: you, our readers.

We usually don’t want you to think about “how the sausage gets made,” but I want to show you that the beta is more than visual changes to the site. It’s also about empowering collaboration, with an architecture that helps bridge divides across teams and continents, and between reporters and readers - to ensure that the Guardian’s journey into a vibrant digital future is one we’re all on together.
