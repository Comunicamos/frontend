Whether it's North America's [most extreme weather in a decade](http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/jan/09/us-polar-vortex-the-best-pictures) or a case study in [jazzing up your dog](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2013/jun/18/dog-grooming-competition-in-pictures), there's always more to discover in the Guardian's photo journalism archives. There are almost thirty thousand galleries available on the site and in our apps, from [Lebanon in 2006](http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/jan/30/lebanon.israelandthepalestinians) to [Gaza in 2014](http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/aug/12/living-with-loss-in-gaza-in-pictures). In the paper too imagery is central to what we do, quite literally â€“ every day the centrefold is a picture from our [Eyewitness](http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/eyewitness) series. As in the case of this [gay pride](http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/sep/08/celebrating-gay-pride-your-photos) collection, galleries can also be a great outlet for readers who share with us through [Guardian Witness](http://witness.theguardian.com).

Today we're delighted to welcome you to our brand new gallery pages. Historically they've looked different on different devices, and both desktop and mobile views had their deficiencies. We're pleased to replace them both with a single experience that works great whatever device you're using.

Our job when it came to galleries was to get out of the way and let the images do the talking. The familiar grey colour scheme from the video pages [we launched last month](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/video-redesign/) shows the images to their best advantage. We've also made it possible to see our images larger than ever before. Click any image to open it in the "lightbox" view. You can even hide the image caption to enjoy a completely uncluttered experience.

In both views, we've brought more galleries to the fore to make it easier to stay immersed in pictures. On Guardian series like the [Cities in motion](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2014/sep/10/-sp-history-metro-pictures-london-underground-new-york-beijing-seoul) or [From the agencies](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/sep/05/south-korean-dog-show-in-pictures) collections, you'll also notice dedicated onward viewing options within those series.

As always, we'd love to hear what you think.
