Over the last year we have been working on a new version of the Guardian website. Along the way, we’ve been inviting readers into the new site and asking them for their thoughts. To date we’ve received over 26,000 pieces of feedback, helping us make the site better.

We’ve already updated some of our pages, like videos, galleries and live blogs. At the end of last month we unveiled the whole site to all our readers in the United States.

Over the coming weeks and months we’ll be getting ready to bring the site to the rest of our global audience. As part of that we are continuing to test the site with a sample of our readers.

If your experience of theguardian.com has recently changed, you’re probably one of those selected to be part of that group.

## 1. Why am I seeing a different version of theguardian.com?

Our aim is to make sure the new site is as easy to use as possible. We randomly select a small number of people to try out the redesigned site. We’ll be gathering feedback from these people about what works and what doesn’t.  

## 2. Why do you have to test with real users?

The best way to find out if something is working is to show it to our readers and listen to their feedback.

## 3. Why have you changed the site?

We want to make our journalism easier to find and engage with.

On our new front page we’ve made it easier to tell the difference between different kinds of stories. And we’ve collected stories in groups that reflect what our readers want, not how our organisation is structured.

There’s more focus on striking images across the site, particularly in our new video and gallery pages. Articles too have a simpler look with fewer distractions. Live blogs have been reimagined to give you all the information you need whether you have thirty seconds to spend or thirty minutes.

We wanted the site to work well wherever our audience wanted to use it, from their phone in the morning to their desktop at work. The new site adapts to your screen size in hundreds of ways.

Last but not least, we’ve focussed on speed. Our readers have told us how important it is that we don’t keep them waiting. Compared to the current site, the new site takes less than half the time to load.

## 4. How do I submit feedback?

We really value your feedback.  You can fill in our survey [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/theguardian-beta-feedback).

## 5. How do I get back to the old site?

If you really prefer not to take part in our test, for a short period you’ll be able to return to the old version. To do this, scroll down to the bottom of theguardian.com and find the link labelled “Use current version.”

## 6. When will you turn the old site off?

We’ve already unveiled the new site to all of our readers in the US.   We’ll be introducing the new site to the rest of the world over the coming weeks.
