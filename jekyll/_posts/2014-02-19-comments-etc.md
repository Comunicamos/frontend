title: How we work on the beta
author: cantlin
summary: There may never have been a more exciting time to work at the Guardian.

One of the most exciting, groundbreaking parts of our beta project is how much of it is happening out in the open. Every day we're experimenting with new ways of doing news, and it's all out there for everyone to see.

Our editorial and engineering colleagues are both a real source of inspiration. Every day Guardian journalists engage with our community both on and off the site, creating the dialogue at the heart of [open journalism](http://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2012/feb/29/alan-rusbridger-open-journalism-guardian-video).

All the while our new website is being developed completely transparently. [Every change to a line of code](https://github.com/guardian/frontend) is out there in the wild for the development community to see.

For us, product development should be no different.

## How does the new beta fit in?

Our new site is best seen in this light of constant change and experimentation. Some parts of it we love, some are experimental, some we know just flat out *need work*. We'll be writing more in the future about the enormous amount of user experience research that drives our thinking.

We believe deeply in listening to our readers. This is the first step in a journey and a dialogue that will ultimately deliver a more beautiful and more engaging Guardian website.

Over the last few weeks we've started to generate real volumes of meaningful feedback. It's been a joy for those of us who work on the product. Live usage data and real user feedback are the fuels that drive great product development.

## How much more change can we expect?

All of the decisions we make about the website are driven by the needs of our readers. That's why we've invited in an audience of early adopters.

What we've opened the doors to is absolutely a **work in progress**. We love parts of what we've done and we're thrilled to share it. That doesn't mean there aren't bits here and there which don't cut the mustard.

Our comment experience, for example, isn't where we want it to be. The engagement data is clear cut. We're excited to work with our community over the coming year to make that right.

## Where can we get updates?

We'll be talking about all our releases here on the product blog. If you'd like to get links to these updates by email, let us know in the comments and we'll set something up.
