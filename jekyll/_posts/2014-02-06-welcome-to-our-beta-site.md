summary: You may be wondering why we are redesigning our site now, and the reason is simple.
---
Hello. This blog is where we'll share our latest thinking as we test ideas for our new beta site. We're also busily updating our core apps, which will be available from the Apple and Android stores this spring.

The reason for this evolution of our apps and website is simple. We have rapidly evolved from a UK newspaper to a global, cross-platform digital news brand with a global audience of more than 40m readers. We're now the third most popular English-language newspaper website in the world and our journalism is reaching more people than ever before.

This growth has been fuelled by the explosion in smartphones and tablets, and we want you to have the best experience of our content, whatever device you're using. One way we'll ensure this is with responsive design. See it in action by [clicking here](http://www.theguardian.com/preference/platform/mobile?page=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fuk%3Fview%3Dmobile) and making your browser window bigger and smaller; you'll see the pages adapt to fit.

The beta site is faster than the current site and our new designs are beautiful and simple, so you can find the content you're looking for, discover new writers and stories, and, crucially, come back to read more.

We believe in testing as we develop, in an open, live environment â€“ in the same way many digital companies build, test and launch their products. All our code is on [GitHub](http://github.com/guardian/frontend) and our engineering team have their own [developer blog](http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog?view=responsive).

At the moment we're only testing the beta front page and article pages, but we will be experimenting and enriching the beta site every day. We want to hear from you at every step of the way: what works and what doesn't? The more feedback the better.

We'll also learn from the way you explore the beta site, so please take your time and have a good look round. And when you're ready to share your thoughts, head [here](https://s.userzoom.com/m/MSBDMTBTMTE5).

We hope you like it.
