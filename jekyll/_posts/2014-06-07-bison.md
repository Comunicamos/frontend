Recently a new term has joined the Guardian's unique layout lexicon.

It was already home to pixies, super pixies, muggies, mini-bentos, bentos, snaps, slot rules and shuffle showcases. Lore known only to the trusted few. Collectively, these names form an elaborate hazing ritual that ensure new starters are not able to contribute meaningfully for at least the first three months of their employ.

In recent weeks attentive visitors to the newsroom would have been able to hear subeditors, purposefully striding across the floor, asking *"Can someone get me a* ***bison*** *on this piece?"*

## Return of the European Bison

*Bisoning* got its name in May from an [article](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/21/-sp-european-bison-europe-romania-carpathian-mountains) by Guardian environment editor [Adam Vaughan](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/adam-vaughan).

It refers to the bovine star of the main image, who stretches arrestingly to full width across tablet and desktop layouts.

<span style="font-family:EgyptianHeadline,georgia,serif;font-weight:900;">Three months ago</span> all content on our beta site looked, as it does on the current site, more or less the same. Breaking news or reflective long form, our rendering engines treated it all with the same cavalier insouciance.

In February, videographer [Laurence Topham](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/laurencetopham), journalist [Alok Jha](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alokjha) and producer [Mustafa Khalili](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mustafa-khalili) approached the website product team sheepishly. Alok and Laurence had been on a dramatic trip to Antarctica and spent months marooned on a vessel stranded in ice. They wanted a better look for the 3,000 words and 20 minute video they'd come back with. They knew that ordinarily the engineering, design and UX teams that develop the website donâ€™t work on individual pieces of editorial. Still, they asked us for help.

## Rescue from Antarctica

The result was [Rescue from Antarctica](http://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/2014/feb/28/-sp-rescue-from-antarctica), a longform prototype that introduced features like variable image and video sizing, cinemagraphs and pull quotes.

<div style="padding:10px 0;margin:0 auto;width:500px"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>This is what great editorial work for the Web looks like. <a href="http://t.co/MGdnWvCzIg">http://t.co/MGdnWvCzIg</a></p>&mdash; Smashing Magazine (@smashingmag) <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag/statuses/439355462891606016">February 28, 2014</a></blockquote></div>

<!-- Changing the way content is created, stored, distributed and rendered in a large media company with many decoupled systems and numerous teams is not straightforward. Those who work on tools for journalists suffer from a chicken and egg problem: why should they add a feature in their editor when the intervening systems may not store and distribute it? Even if it does make it to the rendering layer, what guarantee do they have that that team will stop what they're doing and implement the new functionality? -->

The code that caused the Antarctica article to behave differently to everything else on the site was what we call a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_(computer_science)#In_computer_science">hack</a>" (that we've [since removed](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/commit/5defacf8116412d2ef5ee99472ab3a5113262151)). Nothing to do with cyber-terrorism, just a word for some ugly engineering thrown together quickly for a one off job. The features it introduced only worked on that one page, and you needed a developer sitting next to you to change them.

<div style="color:#999;font-size:15px;padding:0 0 10px 0;">Element "weighting" allows the journalist or subeditor to embed images, videos and interactive components at variable sizes throughout the copy.</div>

The brilliance of the Antarctica hack was that it wasn't a hack: it was reusable. The teams came up with an idea for an extra layer of metadata, and the special styles were created to pretend it existed. In this way Antarctica laid the ground work for an [increasingly](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/27/-sp-special-report-an-outsiders-guide-to-the-city-of-london) [long](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/31/-sp-brazil-2014-world-cup-photo-essay) [list](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/27/-sp-racism-on-rise-in-britain) of articles using functionality it pioneered.

## Colour, tone, voice

Part of bringing our content to life, both on the web and in our [new apps](http://www.theguardian.com/global/ng-interactive/2014/may/29/-sp-the-guardian-app-for-ios-and-android), is treating it in a way that's sensitive to its tone. Another component of the *bison* treatment is the purple bar that spans the screen. It's a look we've been exploring for our features.

We believe using visual design to convey the tone of a piece upfront makes deciding what to read easier for our users. Sympathetic colours make different styles of writing identifiable, and set the right expectations and context for readers.

An advantage of treating content more sympathetically is that we can emphasize the parts of it that really matter. A good example is the new look for [opinion pieces](http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment), which bring a real sense of authorship to the page.

We're just starting out on a journey towards a richer, more diverse, more compelling digital editorial experience. As always, we'd love to know what you think.
