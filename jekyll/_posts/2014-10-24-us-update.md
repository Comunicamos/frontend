We are now just days away from launching our new site to all US readers. It's a site that we have designed around your feedback, with our journalism at its heart.
 
We wanted to create a place for you to discover and consume more of our award-winning journalism, more often. An experience that is easy to use, regardless of which device you’re using, and where you’re accessing it from.

[Built in the open](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/making-beta-better/), we invited our readers to try out the new site in beta since February. We have a very passionate, very loyal readership and thanks to your 25,000 pieces of feedback, we have been able to shape, develop and improve the site in the open, every step of the way. 

## So what’s new?

The first thing you’ll notice is the new look and feel, a more elegant and engaging blend of images, video and text.
 
The design now centres around a flexible [‘container’](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/container-model-blended-content/) format, which reflects the way news is consumed, rather than how it is produced. Containers can be customised in a variety of different ways to highlight stories, and allow editors to think beyond simply building a page, to creating a collection of stories that bring each day’s news to life for readers.

There’s also an abundance of new features: from redesigned [video](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/video-redesign/) and [gallery](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/gallery-redesign/) pages, new-look [live blogs](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/liveblog-redesign/), new type and iconography, a new colour palette to guide people to specific sections, stories and writers.

The new site is also faster – connecting you to the stories of the day, the hour and the minute, even more quickly.

Navigation is now more consistent across the site. It’s much more focussed, making it easier to learn and find the common sections. We have allowed you to jump to any section from any page from the 'all sections' list.

Commercially, we have integrated advertising more intelligently into the design.   This includes a new fully responsive, full width ad format that works across all devices. 

We’re really proud of the new site and we hope you like it. Please leave your thoughts and comments on our [feedback form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/theguardian-us-edition-feedback).
