Soon we'll be starting to roll out the new Guardian site. It has been designed around your feedback, with our journalism at its heart.
 
We wanted to create a place for you to discover and consume more of our award-winning journalism, more often. An experience that is easy to use, regardless of which device you’re using, and where you’re accessing it from.

[Built in the open](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/making-beta-better/), we have invited our readers to try out the new site in beta since February. We have a very passionate, very loyal readership and thanks to your feedback we have been able to shape, develop and improve the site in the open, every step of the way.

## So what’s new?

The first thing you’ll notice is the new look and feel, a more elegant and engaging blend of images, video and text.

The design will center around a flexible [‘container’](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/container-model-blended-content/) format - a new way of approaching content curation and presentation.

There’s also an abundance of new features: from redesigned [video](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/video-redesign/) and [gallery](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/gallery-redesign/) pages, new-look [live blogs](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/liveblog-redesign/), new type and iconography, a new colour palette to guide people to specific sections, stories and writers.

The navigation is now much more consistent across the site. It’s much more focussed, making it easier to learn and find the common sections. We have allowed you to jump to any section from any page from the 'all sections' list.

We’re really proud of the new site and we hope you like it. Please leave your thoughts and comments on our [feedback form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/theguardian-au-edition-feedback).
