summary: "Responding to the feedback you're leaving us"
---

Back in February we launched the Guardian beta website. We invited you to use the site and share your feedback with us via a [feedback form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/theguardian-beta-feedback), via social media and in personal interviews. Tens of thousands of you did take part, and here’s an update on what we’ve learned from your feedback and what we've been doing about it. 

Broadly speaking we’ve been able to categorise the feedback into two groups: the first group contains things that many of you are in agreement about and are therefore easy for us to identify, improve and update. The second, however, are personal preferences that are much trickier to address. 

So let’s start with the first.

## The issue: density of news

What you told us: You can’t get an overview of the news because there appears to be “less on the page”. It became clear very quickly that you really wanted a quick, at-a-glance overview of the key news stories with minimum scrolling. In addition, you also wanted a quick way to get other key non-news analysis, opinion and features journalism. 

What we did about it? We developed the concept of a headlines and highlights container, designed the balance right between hierarchy, ease of discovery and richness of display where the story needed it. A result of this is that when entering the new home page, you see more stories than on the old version of the theguardian.com or the early versions of the beta site.

## The issue: comment experience

What you told us: The layout wasn’t compact enough, the text was not legible, refreshing comments took you to random places in the comments. When we first launched the beta there was also no unthreaded view of comments. 

What we did about it? We’ve addressed all these issues, and more. Being open is at the heart of our journalism so it was hugely important for us to get this right. In fact, we place so much importance on commenting that Cantlin, one of our product managers here at the Guardian, has written a whole blog on comments [here](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/comment-update/). We hope you find the comment threads much easier to use and to read. An ongoing issue is the amount of comments you can read in one single view. We keep increasing this amount gradually to test the impact this has on server load. 

## The issue: finding your favourite content 

What you told us: Help - you can’t find your favourites! With the new design and navigation, lots of you were finding it difficult to find content.

What we did about it? Lots. We’ve worked hard to make sure that our navigation is simpler, easier and faster to find sections regardless of the device that you’re on. Sections are now clearly displayed on page load - not hidden behind a menu - with a greater level of discoverability available under our ‘all sections’ button.  We’re also adding crosswords, Today’s paper and other items to the navigation. Our regular features, like Football Weekly, will soon be found in their related section in their own container, where you can clearly see the latest of each feature. We’re not saying it’s perfect, but as more and more readers use the site, we will continue to improve it in the future.
With the ‘all sections’ function, all sub-sections are only one click away from the homepage. And, for the first time, you can see all of the Guardian’s sections and subsections in one single view. 

# Other feedback

With over 114m unique browsers every month, it’s little wonder that there will be some disagreement out there about some of the new features and functionality of the new site. Here’s some of the main areas of feedback you’ve shared with us that you don’t always agree on...

## Fonts

Some of you like the font, others don’t. Some of you think it’s too large, others are unfussed or like it a lot. Changing the font is not something we did lightly and you can hear from our creative director, Alex Breuer, about the choice of font size and our use of typography [here](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/designing-in-the-open/). Essentially, we wanted to create a clear and elegant reading experience so it was easier for you to dig deeper into a story or discover more Guardian journalism. Part of this was looking at font size. Yes it is still a little larger than the current site, but we are confident that we have settled on a size that is the correct balance between a greater ease of reading and limited scrolling. 

## Image sizes

Images are a key element of great storytelling, and we know how much our readers value our attention to the quality of the photojournalism we use. The consensus was that the current site had a large number of images but often the quantity and size of these (many are what we call thumbnail) meant they didn’t really contribute to the narrative of a particular story or to the hierarchy of stories.  Our new layout (using, what we call, “containers”) enables us to integrate images more effectively. As part of the evolution of the new website we also want our pictures to communicate hierarchy or what we call the relative importance of stories to each other, so on the new site you will often see fewer, but better displayed images. 

## Use of colour

Those of you have been enjoying the guardian for some time will know that we have never shied away from using colour in our design - the current site has colour variation in the navigation and on home pages and articles and, generally speaking, this was an evolution of what we used in print. One of the most salient pieces of feedback was that many of you often clicked on links on both articles and home pages and were surprised at your ultimate destination, in terms of the article type and whether you were about to read an opinion piece, a liveblog, a news story or a feature. To improve this, we introduced what we call a “tonal colour language”, the goal being to give clear visual distinction between different journalistic tones and types. So this is how we have broken down the tones: news carries the core guardian blue colour; live content is boldly marked with red; galleries, videos and other multimedia take a gun metal hue; and opinion is vibrant orange; non-news (features) carries a purple tone; and review articles are yellow. 

## Adverts

We work closely with our readers, viewers and with our advertisers to find the best balance of editorial and commercial elements on the site and we work hard to make sure our adverts are as unobtrusive as possible. Many of you have voiced your dislike of adverts appearing before short videos, and that adverts are auto-playing every return visit you make. We are aware of this, as well as the frequency of adverts seen on the site, as serious issues and are reviewing this over the coming weeks. The autoplay advert now only happens on the first load of a video.

## Breaking news ticker

Our breaking news ticker is no more, but that doesn’t mean it’s gone for good. We’re working on new ways to deliver breaking news to you and, crucially, we can now publish breaking news to our front page in seconds, rather than minutes.

## “The site was built for mobile, with no desktop consideration”

This simply isn’t the case. As Nick Haley [outlined in his blog](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/feedback-so-far/), we started with a mobile solution and scaled appropriately. The new website has been carefully crafted to deliver a greater journalistic experience across any device, regardless of the screen’s size, and mobile was the first step in delivering this experience. We can also see that while there is a lot of talk in the media about desktop traffic going away. Both the Guardian’s desktop traffic as well as its mobile traffic are growing strongly. We have a strong interest in providing you with an excellent experience on desktop devices as much as on tablets or smartphones. 

## Keep your comments coming

Thank you for all your comments - positive or negative - and please keep it coming. We are listening and want to make sure you can see the changes and the decisions behind them. Some of the changes mentioned here will be coming over the coming weeks so please bear with us. 

We really value your feedback.  Please fill in our survey [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/theguardian-beta-feedback).
