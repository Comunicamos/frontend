This week we have launched a completely redesigned video player and a new design for our video pages. Over the next few days it will reach all 100 million of our global unique browsers. While our mobile readers have been using the new site for some time now, only five percent of our desktop users have seen it through our beta programme. The launch of our new video pages marks the first time that our many millions of global users will experience part of our new site.

## What has changed?

The first change many users will notice is the bold use of colour - greys and oranges - that will let our viewers know they are visiting a multimedia section of our site. We have already written about <a href="http://next.theguardian.com/blog/bison/">the new ways we are using colour</a> to quickly indicate to a reader whether they have landed on a news article, a feature text, an opinion piece or a video, but for the majority of our users, this will be the first time they will see this in practice.

Next, our video player has been redesigned in line with the <a href="http://next.theguardian.com/blog/designing-in-the-open/">new visual language</a> that we are deploying across our beta site and that is already evident on our new <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/ng-interactive/2014/may/29/-sp-the-guardian-app-for-ios-and-android">Guardian App</a>. The video player provides a cleaner, more elegant viewing experience with an improved end slate that allows users to discover more relevant video content faster.

Our video pages group together related videos into <em>"series"</em>, making it easier to discover and watch videos on similar topics of the same series, while the new "popular videos" section lets readers see what Guardian videos are trending right now.

Crucially, the new video pages are entirely responsive, meaning our video content looks exactly the same regardless of the platform, device and screen size it is being watched on. This focus on responsiveness is at the heart of the new website which is being visited by several thousand different device types with different screen sizes at any given time.

Switching all of our video pages over to this new design is just one step of many towards the new Guardian site, but an important one as for the first time we will now be able to understand how all our readers respond to the site's new look, including its new navigation. Your feedback is extremely valuable to us â€“ <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/guardianvideo">let us know what you think</a>.
