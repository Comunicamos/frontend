At the beginning of February we embarked on a stage of the Guardian’s website redesign project that felt slightly terrifying. We wanted to start
letting more readers interact with our beta site and this meant editing it, 24/7 – while the current site continued to exist and be edited as well.

As anyone who has worked in a digital newsroom will know, every minute of the day is already crammed with commissioning, desking copy, publishing,
updating homepages and many other tasks. How could we edit our beta site without interfering with the day-to-day running of the current one?

When we started to look into the details though, things began to seem a little less worrying. First, we agreed that the main editorial judgements,
such as the order of news stories, would continue to be made on the homepage that most of our readers see – that is, the existing website.

Second, our developers had built us a brilliant new homepage-editing tool which is very easy to use. This meant that the process of editing the new
homepage (or ‘network front’ as it’s known internally) became as simple as dragging links from our existing site and dropping them into our new tool.

We knew right away that this was also the perfect moment to get feedback from more editors about two really important things: 1) using the new editing
tool; and 2) editing the site in a different way, which involves putting stories into some new categories (which we call 'containers'). We had lots of
questions about the latter point: How did it feel to blend news and sport? Are there enough stories to fill the 'people' container at any time, and in
a compelling way? Is there material that doesn't fit into the new model? What containers are missing?

We started 'dual editing' with the UK beta site just over a month ago, and our teams in New York and Sydney joined in over the following weeks.
Network production editor Celine Bijleveld became the point person on the newsroom floor, managing a rota, training up other editors and editing the
beta sites 9am-5pm GMT, Monday-Friday. We soon developed a nice rhythm, via a dedicated email address, of handing over when shifts finished, with
messages sailing between continents at all hours of the day and night about who's picking up/dropping the UK, US and Australia beta sites.

We've been collecting internal feedback regularly too, through standup meetings with editors and an internal feedback form that is reviewed every
week. Many of the comments are about the tool – it has attracted a lot of praise but is still a work in progress, lacking a preview function and an
easy way to change pictures among other things. We've also been discussing wider editorial questions: should we broaden our definition of the kind of
journalism that can be presented in the news container? What are the arguments for and against a sport container on the home page? When should we
populate a container around a special theme or event? And how can we stop the people container being full of stories about middle-aged white men?!

These discussions, and many more, are ongoing, just like the dual editing process itself – we have to keep it up until the website is fully designed,
developed and launched. It has certainly been a stretch at times - lots of editors and production staff have helped at evenings or weekends on top of
their day jobs - but it is also an exciting stage of the project, allowing so many more editors to get involved and shape the future of our new
website.
