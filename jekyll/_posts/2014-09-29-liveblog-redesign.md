The Guardian's [first ever live blog](http://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/mar/17/newsstory.sport10?view=desktop), coverage of an apparently eventful 1-1 draw between Inter Milan and Manchester United, was published just over fifteen years ago. The now adolescent format has blossomed since birth to encompass breaking news, politics, business and the major events of the calendar, from the [Scottish referendum](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence+tone/minutebyminute) to the [Great British Bake Off](http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off+tone/minutebyminute). As recently as June 2014 Guardian live blogs won Best Commentary/Blogging at the [Online Media Awards](http://www.onlinemediaawards.net/results).

Live blogs are a type of content special to digital. Since it began their rolling coverage has presented unique challenges to journalists and technologists alike. Readers tell us they love not having to wait for the latest update. The challenge has always been in avoiding pushing the work of collecting, arranging and interrogating information back to the reader.

Following our [video](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/video-redesign/) and [gallery](http://next.theguardian.com/blog/gallery-redesign/) releases, we're thrilled today to introduce new live blogs on theguardian.com. The new page balances breaking updates with an at-a-glance summary.

As the story develops some updates are tagged "key events". These show in a timeline view on the left of the page. Readers who are new to the story or just looking for the last big development should find this a much quicker way of getting up to speed. Each key event can be clicked to jump to the full update in the live feed.

[Paul Owen](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paulowen), who is responsible for the Guardian's UK live blogs, said: "Once live blogs have been going for more than an hour or two, it becomes difficult for a new reader to start reading; by that point the live blog has often become rather long and unwieldy.

"For a while we have asked the live bloggers to periodically add bullet-point summaries of key events - say at the beginning of the blog, half way through the day, and when wrapping up. But these only really help if the new reader starts reading the blog soon after a summary has been published.

"So we hope pulling up key events into a clickable list at the top or top left of each live blog will now help readers navigate through a live blog at whatever point they choose to join it. Summaries will remain too, though."

## What's the score?

When a game is afoot, there's even more we can do to make getting at the key information as simple as possible.

We've pulled scores up to the top of the page and added new [data visualisations](http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2014/sep/27/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live) showing a host of match stats and league standings.

## Sharing

Finally, we've made sharing individual updates much easier by adding social buttons to each block.

As always, we'd love to hear what you think.
