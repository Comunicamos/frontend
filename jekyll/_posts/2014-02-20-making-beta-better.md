The way that we are creating the new Guardian website is different from how we’ve made big changes before. Previously, we’d have spent quite a long time designing and then building everything. We would then get the thoughts and opinions from a wide range of our readers once we’d launched it to the world.

We think a better way is to seek and then use feedback from our most loyal and engaged audiences throughout the design and build phases.

This is what we are now doing with the beta version of theguardian.com. We are experimenting with ideas and we are testing those ideas in the open with a sample of users who opt-in to this version.

One of the big challenges we and other content sites face is the fact that people are accessing theguardian.com from an incredible range of devices: more than 5,000 different mobile handset models every week. We want to ensure as far as possible that the experience you have is as good as possible.

Our solution is a responsive site that adjusts to the screen size and other aspects of your device. That is an editorial, design and technical challenge and will take time to get right.

By using the beta you can see the early stages of the new site as we experiment with features, design and layout.

We know the early version site is far from finished. That’s why we are only sharing it with a very small percentage of our total audience. But we believe it’s better to let people in and tell us what they think. That way we can make it better, faster.

We know from talking with users that the current site, whilst familiar, is not always that easy to use. We produce 500 pieces of journalism per day across an amazing range of areas and we’re not doing it justice. Our goal is simple: we want you to be able to find even more great content than you could before.

At the moment we are mostly looking at how articles could work better and how the main network front or home page can be organised. The rest of the site has not had much attention yet. We haven't started working on Comment is Free or Sport or most of the other pages -- so don't panic if a favourite site or page looks unfinished. It is. There is lots still to do.

We’ll be writing more in the future about specific areas of the changes. This will include the editorial thinking behind the new site as well as the approach we’ve taken to user experience research, product management and details of our engineering principles and technology choices.

One of things we’re particularly excited about is the open approach to development. If you’re a software engineer, you can find all of our code available [on Github](https://github.com/guardian/frontend).

Over the last few weeks we’ve started to receive really useful feedback. This plus audience usage data will help ensure that our product development is successful and that the end result is a new Guardian site that is enjoyed by millions of people around the world.

## How much more change can I expect?

What we’ve opened the doors to is absolutely a work in progress but we’re thrilled to share it -- even the unfinished parts. 

One area that we know many of you feel passionately about is the comment experience. We already know that more work is needed and with your help and suggestions we will make it better. Other people have asked questions about fonts sizes or about the navigation bar. As you come back each day you will see elements on the beta start to change as we experiment with different versions or implement new ideas in response to the feedback we receive.

## Where can I get updates?

We’ll be writing about all our releases here on our blog. If you’d like to get links to these updates by email, let us know in the comments and we’ll set something up.

## What do you think?

Please use the [feedback form](https://s.userzoom.com/m/MSBDMTBTMTE5) to let us know your views. There is also the comment thread below. These will be open for the next few days and we’ll be reading everything that comes in and responding where we can.
