If that were true, wages might not start to rise until spare capacity in the labour market were fully used up. Since monetary policy, too, could be expected to operate only with a lag, it was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank Rate in advance of them. </p> </blockquote> <p>Weale and McCafferty also argued that there was no guarantee that the risks of a negative financial market reaction would be lessened by holding rates down for longer.

So the minutes of the latest Bank of England monetary policy meeting, released at 9.30am today, are eagerly awaited in the City and beyond.</p> <p>There’s a possibility that at least one member of the MPC broke ranks and voted to raise bank rate. This would be the first dissent since 2011. </p> <p>Alternatively, the nine-strong committee could have remained united in leaving borrowing costs unchanged, which would probably kibosh talk of an early rate rise. </p> <p>The details of the minutes should also show whether many committee members believe that most of the spare capacity in the UK economy has now been used up.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/19/uk-cpi-inflation-fall-lessens-interest-rate-rise\">Yesterday’s drop in inflation appears to have put a 2014 rate rise off the agenda</a> - but today’s minutes could change the picture again.... <br /></p> <p><strong>Stan Shamu </strong>of <strong>IG</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The focus will be on the BoE MPC meeting minutes, where the market will be looking for any signs that some members are getting hawkish.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last week’s BoE inflation report showed there was “a wide range of views” over the amount of slack that still needs to be mopped up. However, Britain’s weak wage growth remained a major worry, so we’ll see what the MPC said about that too.</p> <p>Not too much else on the agenda today. We get the latest survey of the eurozone construction sector at 10am BST, and the CBI’s survey of UK industrial trends at 11am.</p> <p><em><strong>I’ll be tracking the main events through the day...</strong></em></p> </div>   </div>","headline":"Bank of England split 7-2 over interest rates - business live","trailText":"Monetary Policy Committee minutes show that two members of the committee voted to raise interest rates to 0.75%","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408514326483/ef3b5147-9bc7-4a44-9a50-1f42d280aad7-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"2034","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"445022017","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"53f438b5e4b0f23fdd9352de","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Graeme Wearden","displayRelativeTimes":"false","internalPageCode":"2144777","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"true","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-23T07:00:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live","tags":[{"id":"business/series/guardian-business-live","webTitle":"Guardian business live","description":"On our daily blog we provide live news coverage of the latest events in global financial markets, the economy and major corporate moves, with instant reaction and analysis from our own team of reporters and experts around the world ","type":"series","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/guardian-business-live","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/series/guardian-business-live","references":[]},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/debt-crisis","references":[]},{"id":"business/series/eurozone-crisis-live","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis live","description":"On our daily blog we report on the turmoil in the bond, stock and currency markets - as well as the political dramas at the heart of the eurozone crisis.","type":"series","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/eurozone-crisis-live","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/series/eurozone-crisis-live","references":[]},{"id":"business/bankofenglandgovernor","webTitle":"Bank of England","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor","references":[]},{"id":"business/economicgrowth","webTitle":"Economic growth (GDP)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economicgrowth","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/economicgrowth","references":[]},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/economics","references":[]},{"id":"business/blog","webTitle":"Business blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/blog","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/minutebyminute","webTitle":"Minute by minutes","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/minutebyminute","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/graemewearden","webTitle":"Graeme Wearden","r2ContributorId":"19202","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/7/1399476600504/Graeme-Wearden.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/7/1399476625361/Graeme-Wearden-L.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Graeme Wearden tracks the latest world business, economic and financial news in our daily liveblog.
